# Generic_BinaryHeapPriorityQueue
SDSU CS310 Spring 2018 Programming Assignment #3

For this assignment, you will write one more implementations of a Priority Queue. Using the same interface as program #1, you will write a binary heap implementation.
Your heap implementation must have identical behavior, and must implement the PriorityQueue interface used in program #1. The implementation must have two constructors as in the first assignment--use the DEFAULT_MAX_CAPACITY in the interface for one constructor and take a size parameter for the second.

Thus, your project will consist of the following files. You must use exactly these filenames.   
    • PriorityQueue.java The ADT interface (provided in prog1)    
    • BinaryHeapPriorityQueue.java The binary heap implementation.    
Additional Details:     
    • Each method must be as efficient as possible. That is, a O(n) is unacceptable if the method could be written with O(log n) complexity. Both insert and removemust be O(log n)   
    • Your BinaryHeap must be stable--able to determine the oldest entry among those with identical priority.
    • Your iterator must be fail-fast.    
    • You may not make any modifications to the PriorityQueue interface provided. I will grade your project with my copy of this file. This interface is UNCHANGED from projects #1 and #2    
    • All relevant requirements from the first assignment apply here.
